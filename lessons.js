            "So, it's a Pokémon game this time. You certainly don't need me to tell you about this one, so instead of a mini-review I'll just talk about my own personal experiences with this series, along with giving a couple fun facts about the game you might not know.",
            "I did not grow up with Pokémon, since it didn't come out in America until I was already in college. I did grow up with older Game Boy RPGs, such as Great Greed and the Final Fantasy Legend games, all of which I still love to this day, so when this hot new Game Boy RPG came out, I was down!",
            "The quirky NPCs reminded me very much of Earthbound, and the gameplay was fun. I did really enjoy the game, especially since it gave me one of my earliest tastes of how we would use the Nintendo Switch. At the time, I had a Super Game Boy in addition to my handheld Game Boy. I would play the game at school between my classes, then bring it home, pop the cart in my Super NES, and play some more. This wasn't the very first time I would enjoy a game this way (I played Phantasy Star 4 half on vacation and half at home about a year prior,) and I loved the experience of having that versatility.",
            "I do have one major issue with the Pokémon series, and it haunted me through my initial playthrough of Red, and then happened again when I played Platinum (the next entry I would get very far in,) and for the same reason. That reason is that it's too easy to screw yourself over near the end. Of course, the game isn't unwinnable, but it's very easy to get through the game with a team that's wholly inadequate for the Elite 4. I don't remember what my team in Red was, but I do remember that I was pretty ok in Platinum, except for the fact that I didn't have any Pokémon that could go up against a particularly difficult Pokémon at the end. I would've had to catch a Tentacruel and grind it for about 5-10 hours, and I wasn't willing to do that, so I stopped playing.",
            "I have since played SoulSilver and Black, and finished those, and I managed to finish both, but only because I looked up a Let's Play of the games and used the same team the LPer did. This doesn't seem to me the way the games should be played, and they would be a lot more fun if it weren't so easy to necessitate a grind near the end, so this fact does knock the games' quality down several notches in my book.",
            "Now that you think I suck at Pokémon, let's get to the fun facts. First is a bit of a misnomer about the series. Many people see 'Pokémon Blue' and think that it's exactly the same as the US Blue. It isn't. When the games were initially released in Japan, Red and Green were the first two that came out. Eight months later, Pokémon Blue, the first 'third version' came out, boasting new Pokémon graphics and some new text. The way the US releases were handled is to take the new graphics and script of Japanese blue and put them into Japanese red and green, and then rename green to blue. The names were kept the same as Japanese when FireRed and LeafGreen rolled around, rather than renaming the latter WaterBlue or some such.",
            "Also in the anime, Ash and Gary were named after real people. Ash was Satoshi, named after Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri, and Gary is Shigeru, named after Shigeru Miyamoto. I guess Tajiri needed a rival, and appropriately enough for someone wanting to be the every best like no one ever was, he picked the person who might well be the greatest game creator of all time.",
            "I do not have a complete copy of Japanese blue, but what you're seeing in that picture is a special box set sold when the Pokémon games went on sale on the 3ds eShop. It comes with a map of Kanto and a few other goodies. That card you see there has a code on the back redeemable for a download."

                "Don't worry about the grammar of that last line, we'll come back to that in a later lesson where I'll refer back to this game as an extra example. For this, I want to focus on how to say something is easy to do.",
                "The line is ‘たんパン　うごき やすくって　いいぜ！　おまえも　はけば？’ The part of the sentence that means ‘Easy to move around in’ is うごき やすくって. This is an adjective conjugation, recall our lesson from Tales of Destiny, where the い at the end of an adjective becomes くて if you're connecting it to another adjective. This kid adds a っ just because he's speaking a little funny.",
                "So, if you wanted to say ‘easy to move around in,’ you'd deconjugate this to うごき やすい. In order to make this from any verb, we take the verb stem (the masu form minus the masu,) and add やすい. Of course we can conjugate this like any other adjective (うごき やすくない, うごき やすかった etc.)"
