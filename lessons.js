            "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (The Dreaming Island in Japan, see the Japanese lesson for further details on that,) is one of the best games the Zelda series has ever produced. The reason for this is fairly obvious, while most games are produced as someone's 9-5 job, this one was a labor of love. The team behind it developed the game after work while working on other things during the day, and the fun they had working on it comes across while playing it. This sort of development also happened on another game that's considered a masterpiece, Mega Man 2.",
            "The story involves the same Link from Link to the Past getting shipwrecked on an island to the south of Hyrule, where he can't leave unless he wakes the island's deity, known as the Wind Fish. The story takes a major turn around Level 6 that recontextualizes everything and forces Link to make a major decision about the right way to proceed, culminating in an ending with levels of emotion you didn't really see in 8-bit RPGs (except Final Fantasy Adventure.)",
            "Of course, the best thing about this game's story are the individual characters you'll meet along the way and the cool moments that stick with you. For example, if you can't afford the (really expensive) bow, you can steal it from the shop. If you do this, the next time you go into the store, the store owner will zap you with lightning, killing you outright, and everyone in the game will call you THIEF instead of your name.",
            "Back in 1993, when you bought a handheld game, you tended to get a scaled down version of its home console equivalent. This is, of course, because of a major difference in technology between a 4 color Game Boy and a 16-bit powerhouse Super NES. Link's Awakening, however, does not scale down the gameplay of Link to the Past at all. Because of this, Link's Awakening easily qualifies as a top 10 Game Boy game. The game is even loved enough to have gotten a remake on the Switch, which is something no one would have guessed would happen.",
            "The not toned down gameplay did have one caveat, however. If you ask most people what Link's Awakening's major drawback is, they'll tell you that you have to switch items a lot. While this can be annoying, this was unavoidable. In Link to the Past, you had three action buttons in game: A sword button, an button that lets you use an item of your choosing, and one that has many common actions mapped to it (lifting items, dashing etc.) The Game Boy only had two buttons to work with, so they made both of them use items that you select, and made the sword, the dash boots, the power glove, and many others items that you map to those buttins at will. This forces the player to open the menu and switch items far more than in other Zelda games, which can be annoying, but was a fair compromise, and honestly the only way they could've made this game without scaling back the gameplay to Zelda 1 levels.",
            "The soundtrack by Kazumi Totaka, Minako Hamano, and Kozue Ishikawa is excellent, boasting many amazing tracks. Highlights include the Face Shrine, the Wind Fish's Egg, and of course the Ballad of the Wind Fish (which even got lyrics in the Switch remake.) The only weak link is the Angler's Tunnel theme. Back in the day, I was really enjoying the level themes, and by the time I was going for level 4, I was looking forward to them. Then I entered level 4 and heard a sped up version of the cave theme. This was probably one of the most disappointing musical experiences of my young life. It's only one song, but the disappointment was memorable enough to leave an impression on me.",
            "Link's Awakening is a true classic, and deserves to be played by any fan of the Zelda series, whether they were born in 1993 or not. And for my fellow old geezers, the game is 28 years old now, so there many Zelda fans that weren't born when we were screwing up our eyesight for life staring at that unlit 4 color screen for hours on end.",
            "And one more thing, the next time you're playing Ocarina of Time, don't forget to lose to the final boss so that this and Link to the Past (the best Zelda games) come to pass."

            "So, it's a Pokémon game this time. You certainly don't need me to tell you about this one, so instead of a mini-review I'll just talk about my own personal experiences with this series, along with giving a couple fun facts about the game you might not know.",
            "I did not grow up with Pokémon, since it didn't come out in America until I was already in college. I did grow up with older Game Boy RPGs, such as Great Greed and the Final Fantasy Legend games, all of which I still love to this day, so when this hot new Game Boy RPG came out, I was down!",
            "The quirky NPCs reminded me very much of Earthbound, and the gameplay was fun. I did really enjoy the game, especially since it gave me one of my earliest tastes of how we would use the Nintendo Switch. At the time, I had a Super Game Boy in addition to my handheld Game Boy. I would play the game at school between my classes, then bring it home, pop the cart in my Super NES, and play some more. This wasn't the very first time I would enjoy a game this way (I played Phantasy Star 4 half on vacation and half at home about a year prior,) and I loved the experience of having that versatility.",
            "I do have one major issue with the Pokémon series, and it haunted me through my initial playthrough of Red, and then happened again when I played Platinum (the next entry I would get very far in,) and for the same reason. That reason is that it's too easy to screw yourself over near the end. Of course, the game isn't unwinnable, but it's very easy to get through the game with a team that's wholly inadequate for the Elite 4. I don't remember what my team in Red was, but I do remember that I was pretty ok in Platinum, except for the fact that I didn't have any Pokémon that could go up against a particularly difficult Pokémon at the end. I would've had to catch a Tentacruel and grind it for about 5-10 hours, and I wasn't willing to do that, so I stopped playing.",
            "I have since played SoulSilver and Black, and finished those, and I managed to finish both, but only because I looked up a Let's Play of the games and used the same team the LPer did. This doesn't seem to me the way the games should be played, and they would be a lot more fun if it weren't so easy to necessitate a grind near the end, so this fact does knock the games' quality down several notches in my book.",
            "Now that you think I suck at Pokémon, let's get to the fun facts. First is a bit of a misnomer about the series. Many people see 'Pokémon Blue' and think that it's exactly the same as the US Blue. It isn't. When the games were initially released in Japan, Red and Green were the first two that came out. Eight months later, Pokémon Blue, the first 'third version' came out, boasting new Pokémon graphics and some new text. The way the US releases were handled is to take the new graphics and script of Japanese blue and put them into Japanese red and green, and then rename green to blue. The names were kept the same as Japanese when FireRed and LeafGreen rolled around, rather than renaming the latter WaterBlue or some such.",
            "Also in the anime, Ash and Gary were named after real people. Ash was Satoshi, named after Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri, and Gary is Shigeru, named after Shigeru Miyamoto. I guess Tajiri needed a rival, and appropriately enough for someone wanting to be the every best like no one ever was, he picked the person who might well be the greatest game creator of all time.",
            "I do not have a complete copy of Japanese blue, but what you're seeing in that picture is a special box set sold when the Pokémon games went on sale on the 3ds eShop. It comes with a map of Kanto and a few other goodies. That card you see there has a code on the back redeemable for a download."
